    <h5>What is Microblading?</h5>
    <p>Beauty_Space_NY is dedicated to making you look and feel beautiful effortlessly at ANY time of the day! Long gone
      are the days of penciling in your brows or settling for the "sharpie marker" look of enhanced eyebrows. We
      specialize in all types of a semi-permanent makeup for your brows: Microblading, Ombre Powder, and Microshading.
    </p>
    <p>We can help you achieve natural, youthful eyebrows without the need to apply daily make-up. Imagine waking up and
      showering without your eyebrows washing off! Your perfectly shaped eyebrows will save you so much time in the
      mornings and hundreds of dollars spent on brow make-up, waxing, and the need for bi-weekly threading. Your lavish,
      luscious brows will be the envy of all!</p>
